## **src_main/VSM/** folder 
This particular folder has 3 folders 
    - collision: 
        - straight_line_collision.cpp: file for the experiment to perform straight line collision and observe the impact force on the environment with and without VSM
    - hammering: 
        - hammer_journal.cpp: experiment planned for the Hammering Journal (not used currently). The paper has results from IROS
        - VSM_hammer_impact_strategy.cpp: experiment planned for admittance based adaptation while hammering exceeds a force threshold. This is helpful to reduce the impact force on the robot gearbox- haven't used it yet
    - pHRI: 
        - pHRI_experiment.cpp: peg-hole experiment for evaluating the 2 DoF mechanism
